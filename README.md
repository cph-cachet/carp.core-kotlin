# Domain Model and Application Service Definitions for all CARP Subsystems

[![Publish snapshots status](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin/workflows/Publish%20snapshots/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.core-kotlin/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+snapshots%22) 

This project is part of the [CACHET Research Platform (CARP)](http://carp.cachet.dk/)—an infrastructure supporting researchers in defining, deploying, and monitoring research studies involving data collection on multiple devices at multiple locations. Following [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), this project contains all domain models and application services for all CARP subsystems (depicted below), not having any dependencies on concrete infrastructure. As such, this project defines an open standard for distributed data collection, [available for Kotlin, the Java runtime, and JavaScript](#multiplatform), which others can build upon to create their own infrastructure.

![Subsystem decomposition](https://i.imgur.com/qexzTej.png)

- [**Protocols**](#carp-protocols): Implements open standards which can describe a study protocol—how a study should be run. Essentially, this subsystem has no _technical_ dependencies on any particular sensor technology or application as it merely describes why, when, and what data should be collected.
- [**Studies**](#carp-studies): Supports management of research studies, including the recruitment of participants and assigning metadata (e.g., contact information). This subsystem maps pseudonymized data (managed by the 'deployment' subsystem) to actual participants.
- [**Deployment**](#carp-deployment): Maps the information specified in a study protocol to runtime configurations used by the 'client' subystem to run the protocol on concrete devices (e.g., a smartphone) and allow researchers to monitor their state. To start collecting data, participants need to be invited, devices need to be registered, and consent needs to be given to collect the requested data.
- [**Client**](#carp-client): The runtime which performs the actual data collection on a device (e.g., desktop computer or smartphone). This subsystem contains reusable components which understand the runtime configuration derived from a study protocol by the ‘deployment’ subsystem. Integrations with sensors are loaded through a 'data collection' plug-in system to decouple sensing—not part of core⁠—from sensing logic.
- **Resources**: Contains a simple file store for resources (such as images, videos, and text documents) which can be referenced from within study protocols to be used during a study.
- **Data**: Contains all pseudonymized data. In combination with the original study protocol, the full provenance of the data (when/why it was collected) is known.
- **Analysis**: An analysis subsystem sits in between the data store and 'studies' subsystem, enabling common data analytics but also offering anonimity-preserving features such as k-anonymity.

Not all subsystems are implemented yet. Currently this project contains an unstable (not backwards compatible) alpha version of the protocols, deployment, client, and studies subsystems. Many changes will happen as the rest of the infrastructure is implemented.

To configure a `StudyProtocol`, the following domain objects are involved:

![Protocols Domain Objects](https://i.imgur.com/Qy9KIWS.png)

- [`StudyProtocol`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/StudyProtocol.kt): A description of how a study is to be executed, defining the 'master' devices responsible for aggregating data, the optional devices connected to them, and the `Trigger`s which lead to data collection on said devices.
- [`DeviceDescriptor`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/devices/DeviceDescriptor.kt): Describes any type of electronic device, such as a sensor, video camera, desktop computer, or smartphone that collects data which can be incorporated into the platform after it has been processed by a 'master device' (potentially itself).
- [`MasterDeviceDescriptor`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/devices/MasterDeviceDescriptor.kt): A device which aggregates, synchronizes, and optionally uploads incoming data received from one or more connected devices (potentially just itself). Typically, a desktop computer, smartphone, or web server.
- [`TaskDescriptor`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/tasks/TaskDescriptor.kt): Describes requested `Measure`s and/or output to be presented on a device.
- [`Measure`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/tasks/measures/Measure.kt): Defines data that needs to be measured/collected for a supported `DataType`.
- [`DataType`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/data/DataType.kt): Defines a type of data which can be processed by the platform (e.g., measured/collected/uploaded).
- [`Trigger`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/triggers/Trigger.kt): Any condition on a device which starts or stops tasks at certain points in time when the condition applies. The condition can either be time-bound, based on data streams, initiated by a user of the platform, or a combination of these.
- [`TriggeredTask`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/triggers/TriggeredTask.kt): Specifies a task which at some point during a `StudyProtocol` gets sent to a specific device. This allows modeling triggers which trigger multiple tasks targeting multiple devices.
- [`SamplingConfiguration`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/data/SamplingConfiguration.kt): Contains configuration on how to sample data.
- [`DataTypeSamplingScheme`](carp.protocols.core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/protocols/domain/data/DataTypeSamplingScheme.kt): Specifies the possible sampling configuration options for a `DataType`, including defaults and constraints.

Example study protocol definition to collect GPS and stepcount on a smartphone which can be serialized to JSON:

```kotlin
// Create a new study protocol.
val owner = ProtocolOwner()
val protocol = StudyProtocol( owner, "Track patient movement" )

// Define which devices are used for data collection.
val phone = Smartphone( "Patient's phone" )
{
    // Configure device-specific options, e.g., frequency to collect data at.
    samplingConfiguration {
        geolocation { interval = TimeSpan.fromMinutes( 15.0 ) }
    }
}
protocol.addMasterDevice( phone )

// Define what needs to be measured, on which device, when.
val measures: List<Measure> = listOf( Smartphone.Sensors.geolocation(), Smartphone.Sensors.stepcount() )
val startMeasures = ConcurrentTask( "Start measures", measures )
protocol.addTriggeredTask( phone.atStartOfStudy(), startMeasures, phone )

// JSON output of the study protocol, compatible with the rest of the CARP infrastructure.
val json: String = protocol.getSnapshot().toJson()
```

Example creation of a study based on a study protocol, and adding and deploying a single participant:

```kotlin
val studyService: StudyService = createStudiesEndpoint()

// Create a new study.
val studyOwner = StudyOwner()
var studyStatus: StudyStatus = studyService.createStudy( studyOwner, "Example study" )
val studyId: UUID = studyStatus.studyId

// Let the study use the protocol from the 'carp.protocols' example above.
val trackPatientStudy: StudyProtocol = createExampleProtocol()
val patientPhone: AnyMasterDeviceDescriptor = trackPatientStudy.masterDevices.first() // "Patient's phone"
val protocolSnapshot: StudyProtocolSnapshot = trackPatientStudy.getSnapshot()
studyStatus = studyService.setProtocol( studyId, protocolSnapshot )

// Add a participant.
val email = EmailAddress( "participant@email.com" )
val participant: Participant = studyService.addParticipant( studyId, email )

// Once all necessary study options have been configured, the study can go live.
if ( studyStatus is StudyStatus.Configuring && studyStatus.canGoLive )
{
    studyStatus = studyService.goLive( studyId )
}

// Once the study is live, you can 'deploy' it to participant's devices. They will be invited.
if ( studyStatus.canDeployToParticipants )
{
    // Create a 'participant group' with a single participant, using the "Patient's phone".
    val participation = AssignParticipantDevices( participant.id, setOf( patientPhone.roleName ) )
    val participantGroup = setOf( participation )

    val groupStatus: ParticipantGroupStatus = studyService.deployParticipantGroup( studyId, participantGroup )
    val isInvited = groupStatus.studyDeploymentStatus is StudyDeploymentStatus.Invited // True.
}
```

Most calls to this subsystem are abstracted away by the ['studies'](#carp-studies) and ['client'](#carp-client) subsystems, so you wouldn't call its endpoints directly. Example code which is called when a study is created and accessed by a client:

```kotlin
val deploymentService: DeploymentService = createDeploymentEndpoint()
val trackPatientStudy: StudyProtocol = createExampleProtocol()
val patientPhone: Smartphone = trackPatientStudy.masterDevices.first() as Smartphone // "Patient's phone"

// This is called by `StudyService` when deploying a participant group.
var status: StudyDeploymentStatus = deploymentService.createStudyDeployment( trackPatientStudy.getSnapshot() )
val studyDeploymentId = status.studyDeploymentId

// What comes after is similar to what is called by the client in `carp.client`:
// - Register the device to be deployed.
val registration = patientPhone.createRegistration()
status = deploymentService.registerDevice( studyDeploymentId, patientPhone.roleName, registration )

// - Retrieve information on what to run and indicate the device is ready to collect the requested data.
val patientPhoneStatus: DeviceDeploymentStatus = status.getDeviceStatus( patientPhone )
if ( patientPhoneStatus.canObtainDeviceDeployment ) // True since there are no dependent devices.
{
    val deploymentInformation: MasterDeviceDeployment =
        deploymentService.getDeviceDeploymentFor( studyDeploymentId, patientPhone.roleName )
    val deploymentChecksum: Int = deploymentInformation.getChecksum() // To verify correct deployment.
    deploymentService.deploymentSuccessful( studyDeploymentId, patientPhone.roleName, deploymentChecksum )
}

// Now that all devices have been registered and deployed, the deployment is ready.
status = deploymentService.getStudyDeploymentStatus( studyDeploymentId )
val isReady = status is StudyDeploymentStatus.DeploymentReady // True.
```

Example initialization of a smartphone client for the participant that got invited to the study in the ['studies'](#carp-studies) code sample above:

```kotlin
val deploymentService = createDeploymentEndpoint()

// Retrieve invitation to participate in the study using a specific device.
val account: Account = getLoggedInUser()
val invitation: ParticipationInvitation = deploymentService.getParticipationInvitations( account.id ).first()
val studyDeploymentId: UUID = invitation.participation.studyDeploymentId
val deviceToUse: String = invitation.deviceRoleNames.first() // This matches "Patient's phone".

// Create a study runtime for the study.
val clientRepository = createRepository( deploymentService )
val client = SmartphoneClient( clientRepository, deploymentService )
client.configure {
    // Device-specific registration options can be accessed from here.
    // Depending on the device type, different options are available.
    // E.g., for a smartphone, a UUID deviceId is generated. To override this default:
    deviceId = "xxxxxxxxx"
}
val runtime: StudyRuntime = client.addStudy( studyDeploymentId, deviceToUse )
var isDeployed = runtime.isDeployed // True, because there are no dependent devices.

// Suppose a deployment also depends on a "Clinician's phone" to be registered; deployment cannot complete yet.
// After the clinician's phone has been registered, attempt deployment again.
isDeployed = runtime.tryDeployment() // True once dependent clients have been registered.
```

## <a name="carp-detekt">carp.detekt</a>

Includes static code analysis extensions for [detekt](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt), used when building this project to ensure conventions are followed.

# Multiplatform

This is a [multiplatform Kotlin library](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) which targets both the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** and **JavaScript (JS)**. However, due to (current) limitations of Kotlin, the JS runtime is missing one feature (as indicated by the ignored tests when tests are run for JS): the `Immutable` base class does not enforce immutable implementations of extending classes.

As this project progresses, we intend to include [native targets](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html) as well, starting with iOS.

# Setting up

We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA 2020, as this is the development environment we use and is therefore fully tested.

- Open the project folder in IntelliJ 2020.
- Install the Kotlin plugin (1.3.72-release-IJ2020.1-1) for IntelliJ IDEA: `Tools->Kotlin->Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates`
- To build/test/publish, click "Edit Configurations" to add configurations for [the included Gradle tasks](#gradle-tasks), or run them from the Gradle tool window.

## Gradle tasks

For `carp.core-kotlin`:
- **build**: Builds the full project, for both runtimes, including running unit tests and code analysis.
- **cleanAllTests jvmTest**: Test the full project using JUnit5. `cleanAllTests` is optional, but ensures that test results always show up in IntelliJ; when tasks haven't changed it otherwise lists "Test events were not received".
- **jsTest**: Test the full project using Mocha. Test results only show up in the build output and not in IntelliJ.
- **verifyTsDeclarations**: Verify whether the TypeScript declarations of all modules, defined in `typescript-declarations`, match the compiled JS sources and work at runtime.
- **detekt**: Run code analysis, ignoring failures. Output will still be successful in case code smells are detected. Apply `--rerun-tasks` to always see output, even when ran before.
- **detektPasses**:: Run code analysis, but do not ignore failures. Output will list failure in case code smells are detected.
- **publishSigned**: Publish all projects to Maven using the version number specified in `ext.globalVersion`. This includes documentation, sources, and signing. For this to work you need to configure a `publish.properties` file with a signing signature and repository user in the project root folder. See main `build.gradle` for details.
- **publishSnapshot**: Publish a snapshot build for all projects to Maven, substituting the suffix of the version specified in `ext.globalVersion` with `-SNAPSHOT`.
