# carp.common [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/dk.cachet.carp.common/carp.common/badge.svg)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dk.cachet.carp.common) [![Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)](https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/dk.cachet.carp.common/carp.common?server=https%3A%2F%2Foss.sonatype.org)](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/dk/cachet/carp/common/)

Implements helper classes and base types relied upon by all subsystems.
Primarily, this contains the built-in types used to [define study protocols](carp-protocols.md#domain-objects)
which subsequently get passed to the deployments and clients subsystem.

## Data types

`DataType`s are identified by a given _name_ within a _namespace_ and identify the data contained within matching [`Data`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/data/Data.kt) points.
When a data type describes data relating to a time interval, the time interval isn't stored in the data point body, but in the header of the data point, common to all data point types (e.g., `interbeatinterval`).

[Sensor data types](#sensor-data-types) and [task data types](#task-data-types) can be accessed through [`CarpDataTypes`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/data/CarpDataTypes.kt).
They all reside under the namespace: **dk.cachet.carp**.

[Input data types](#input-data-types) can be accessed through [`CarpInputDataTypes`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/data/input/CarpInputDataTypes.kt).
They all reside under the namespace: **dk.cachet.carp.input**.

### Sensor data types

Passively collected data by hardware sensors is called `SensorData` (implements `Data`).
Sensor data types are device-agnostic.
The goal is that they can be reused for devices by different vendors.
They act as a common data format.

If device-specific data is needed, it can be passed using the `sensorSpecificData` field, which is of type `Data`.
Custom infrastructures built using CARP Core can specify custom `Data` types in their own codebase to hold sensor-specific data.
All [extendable domain objects](carp-protocols.md#extending-domain-objects), including `Data`, can be uploaded to CARP backends that [use the recommended CARP serializers](serialization.md#unknownpolymorphicserializer-deserializing-unknown-types);
they don't need the types at compile time or runtime, although then the data won't be validated on upload.

### Input data types

Data which is typically entered by users, as opposed to collected passively.
`CarpInputDataTypes` links these data types to a reduced set of [`InputElement`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/data/input/elements/InputElement.kt) abstractions.
UI frameworks can map each `InputElement` type to corresponding input fields.
Using helper functions in `CarpInputDataTypes`, the data input by users can be converted from/to strongly typed and validated input `Data`.

| Name                                                                                                          | Description                                        |

| [sex](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/data/input/Sex.kt)               | Biological sex assigned at birth of a participant. |

## Device configurations

Implementations of [`DeviceConfiguration`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/devices/DeviceConfiguration.kt) are used by the framework to describe the _type of device_ used to collect data, its _capabilities_,
and to _configure_ how it participates in the study protocol.

_Primary_ devices ([`PrimaryDeviceConfiguration`](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/devices/PrimaryDeviceConfiguration.kt)),
in addition to supporting data collection from internal sensors,
act as a hub to aggregate, synchronize, and upload incoming data received from one or more connected devices.

## Sampling schemes and configurations

Supports specifying the sampling scheme for a [`DataType`](#data-types), including possible options, defaults, and constraints.

From sampling _schemes_, matching sampling _configurations_ can be created.
Per data type, only one `SamplingConfiguration` is ever active on a device.
The sampling configuration to be used is determined on clients in order of priority:

1. The sampling configuration, if specified in the study protocol, of the `Measure.DataStream` in the last triggered _active_ `TaskConfiguration`. 
   Once a task stops, it is no longer "active".
2. The default sampling configuration, if specified in the study protocol, for the `DeviceConfiguration`.
   This can be retrieved through `PrimaryDeviceDeployment` on the client.
3. The default sampling configuration hardcoded in the `Sensors` sampling schemes of the concrete `DeviceConfiguration`, if none of the previous configurations are present.

Some sampling schemes support specifying a different sampling configuration depending on how much battery is left,
indicated by the "Battery-aware" column.
These extend from [BatteryAwareSampling](../carp.common/src/commonMain/kotlin/dk/cachet/carp/common/application/sampling/BatteryAwareSampling.kt).
